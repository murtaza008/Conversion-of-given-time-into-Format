# Conversion-of-given-time-into-Format
Converting given seconds into Hours:Minutes:Seconds format using C++ programming language.


I made a C++ program, which is used to take input time in seconds from the user than convert it into hours:minutes:seconds format.


In the starting of the main function, I declared variables giventime,hours,minutes,seconds in int data type.


giventime variable is used to store the value given from the user.


Then I prompt the user to Enter the time in seconds.


Then I applied checker to check if time is equal or greater than 0 because time cannot be in negative numbers.


If the given time is in +ive numbers then the program will display the given time in hours:minutes:seconds in console.


If the given time is in -ive numbers then the program will display Invalid Input in console.


Furthermore, I have added comments in the program which ease the user to understand the program easily.
